# task2
DevPhilip Second Task
I have written the code to ensure that the sign up page is responsive. However, there I believe there might be an issue with the fact that I did not try to include the eye slash icon from the beginning and only added it at the end
While I suspect this is the probelem, I am also very aware that I might lack the knowledge to actually do it. You must know that I have almost exhausted online sources on how to get it done.
The solutions I found were all tailored to the tutorial and its no wonder that none of those tutorials paid attention to responsiveness.
Aside from the eye slash issue, I believe I achieved every other task milestone.
Please check and let me know areas that need improvement.
